                You can find help on a detailed <a href="https://github.com/ConfettiMC/datapack/wiki">Confetti Wiki</a>!
                There are also <a href="dev_tools.html">Tools for developers</a> that could automize certain things.

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
                When the data-packs are loaded (starting the server, using <code>/reload</code> command) Confetti will
                delay the internal loading
                process until there's a player online, to ensure several important things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Messages aren't being broadcast to the void, there's a player who can read them</li>
                <li>Certain commands require a player online (such as detecting Minecraft version using
                    <code>DataVersion</code> NBT Tag)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After the condition is met, Confetti will load and process all the registered data-packs.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Confetti also provides a dependency checking for Minecraft & other data-packs. This means:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Players will be notified when using an unsupported minecraft version</li>
                <li>Developers can require things like Libraries, Cores, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Threads</h2>
            <p>
                Confetti has several threads (scheduled functions that are constantly re-scheduling themselves):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tick</strong> - The tick process that is run after the data-packs are loaded
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Player</strong> - The tick executed as & at every player in the world
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Garbage collector</strong> - Removes unused data from data storage and scoreboards. Runs
                    every 30 seconds
                </li>
            </ul>
